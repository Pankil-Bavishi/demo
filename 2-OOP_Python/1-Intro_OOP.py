# Python is Famous just because of it supports 'All of the Concepts',
# 1 - Functional Programming
# 2 - POP Programming
# 3 - OOP Programming

#Class : is a Blue-print or Design for an Object
# Design(Class) can use Once but, its object can be performed many times(Without any Limits)
# If we don't have a design, How can we build something.
# Example : Even before building a 'Tower', you need to create a 'Blue-print' of it.
# If you want a 'Object', you need to Create a 'Class'.

# Syntax : class class_name:
                # Block of Code
# 2 Things we need to Defined in a Class:
#       1) Attributes : or 'Variable'
#       2) Behaviour : or 'Methods' or 'Functions'

# For Accessing a Methods(Functions) of a Class : Specify 'Class Name First.Methods Name'
# One Class can hae Multiples Object.

#Object : is a Instance of a Class.
# It store the Value inside it For Performing the Operations on the Class

# For Creating an Object : you need to specify a 'Object Name = Class Name'.
# Different Object can have Different Behaviour, depend upon what they know, They have a Different behaviour.





#Calling Structure :

# com1 = Computer()
# com2 = Computer()

# Computer.config(com1) #config method belongs to Computer, and then we have to pass Object as a Parameter, which is 'com1'
# Computer.config(com2)

# Another Way for Calling :
# com1.config() # Behind the Scene 'config' take 'com1' as a it's own Parameter, and Passing it to the 'Self Parameter' of,
#     the Method(Function).
# com2.config()


# 'self' is a Object, which you are Passing as a Parameter.
